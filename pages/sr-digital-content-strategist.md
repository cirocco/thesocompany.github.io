### Sr. Digital Content Strategist

The So Company is looking for someone to be the primary Digital Content Strategist for www.vets.gov, a pioneering effort to build a single, unified digital experience for all Veterans. This is a role for someone who has the desire and drive to solve complex problems in a collaborative team-based environment. 

You should be passionate about serving others and intensely motivated to help serve Veterans.  You will have a strong background not only in digital content strategy, but also experience in information architecture, UI/UX especially in the healthcare industry. You must also have excellent communication skills particularly in writing and meeting editorial timelines.

### BACKGROUND

The Department of Veterans Affairs is looking to provide new services and products by applying Human-Centered Design research to new technology initiatives. This research is fueling the development of new products where service providers address the complex needs of the end user not just from the beginning, but throughout the entire product development cycle. For VA, the end user is the Veteran and the new service is vets.gov.

The So Company creates digital content with writers who are both end-user subject matter experts and functional-specific consultants. The So Company was awarded the contract for vets.gov because not only does it offer digital content writing expertise, its people are  Veterans themselves. By employing Veteran subject matter experts and professional digital content writers who are also savvy in the latest agile development methodologies, The So Company has placed itself at the forefront of Veteran-centric digital technological services. 

The So Company was hired to solve a problem: VA customer experience is fragmented, frustrating and confusing. Customers can’t find the information they need when they need it. Users of vets.gov want two things: useful information that’s clearly written and presented, and tools that are easy to find and use. Below are the stated goals and design principles that serve as the charter for The So Company in this endeavor. 

#### Goals
- Unifying and simplifying VA’s digital touch points, dramatically improving customer experience
- Meeting customer needs on the first try, on any device
- Creating a mobile-first platform
- Retooling existing applications and designing new end-to-end experiences, in partnership with business owners across VA
- Providing transparency about our methods and processes

#### Design Principles
- Understand human need: design for people, rather than VA’s systems
- Assume every visitor is new
- Speak clearly, respectfully and directly
- Help people reach their goals every time
- Connect with customers and create opportunities for feedback and dialog
- Research, observe, test and continuously improve
- Measure what matters
- Be device agnostic
- Employ modern development practices – be agile

You will deploy your strong healthcare experience with a creative approach to problem solving in order develop a new strategy for health content on the vets.gov site. This includes developing health literacy guidelines, writing and editing content for unique health topics, expanding into subtopics and contributing to any research effort required.

You will be expected to own the entire digital content lifecycle analyzing, planning, writing, editing, distributing, managing, monitoring, and sunsetting content. In addition, you will work with and draw on your experience in information architecture and delivery technologies.
