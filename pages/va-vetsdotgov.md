### The Problem
VA is looking to provides modern services and products by employing the latest user-centered research findings in their new technology initiatives. They're doing this by adopting the latest commercial technologies in their projects and hiring service providers that understand the needs of the end users. In this case the end user is the Veteran and their family.

By doing this, you get Vets.gov

### The Solution

The So Company creates digital content with writers that are both end-user subject matter experts and functional-specific consultants. For Vets.gov, all of the digital content, written by So Company staff is written by Veterans because it's for Veterans.

Our writers are military family and personnel, Veterans, and disabled Veterans for the Vets.gov content development team.

Furthermore, by employing Veteran subject matter experts and professional digital content writers, who are also savvy in the latest agile development methodologies, the So Company is able to assist with VA to create a truly new kind of Veteran-centric service.
