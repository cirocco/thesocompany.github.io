### Plain Language:

-  An opinion piece in (The New York Times)[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/02/business/dealbook/a-plea-for-plain-english-in-financial-documents.html] made a plea for plain language in investment writing, stating that documents should not begin with boldfaced, all-cap statements that make no sense. They praise Warren Buffett's introduction to the Securities and Exchange Commission's "Plain English Handbook" (really), where he states,
"I pretend that I'm talking to my sisters." His sisters obviously don't work in the government. They also make some suggestions, such as not using "Herein" or all caps. Ever.

-  I onboarded today to get an ID card. "Onboarding" made a (Coffeelicious'
list)[https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/13-more-words-that-everyone-is-tired-of-1f45adcfdba7#] of 13 words everyone is tired of, including "lean," "value bomb" and "integrate."

### Open Data:

-  Some activists argue that open data isn't always used for good: Police
departments across the nation are using "predictive policing" software to
guess where a crime will be and who will commit it, (reports StateScoop)[http://statescoop.com/as-predictive-policing-data-tools-spread-nationwide-civil-rights-advocates-sound-the-alarm].
You know it's going to be that guy in the bathtub with a single bubble
rising from his nose... The problem, besides potential civil rights
violations? The system doesn't appear to reduce crime.

-  This is why you shouldn't mess with female scientists who have access to
data: After lamenting conference after conference and research paper after
research paper that included only male names, BiasWatchNeuro began keeping
track of just how often it happened, (reports The New York Times)[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/science/gender-bias-scientific-conferences.html?_r=3D1].
But it does more than that: It compares those figures to the number of
women who are in a specific field. At about the conferences, the rate of
female speakers matches the rate of women in the field; and at about half,
female speakers fall far below the rate of women in a particular field.

### Open Government:

-  State and local governments in Washington spent $60 million responding
to open-records requests in one 12-month period, making the case yet again
that there has to be an easier way to gain information, (reports The Seattle
Times)[http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/public-records-requests-a-costly-cornerstone-of-democracy-60m-over-12-months/].


-  California, after a pilot program, has officially opened its first
open-data portal, (reports Government Technology)[http://www.govtech.com/civic/This-Week-in-Civic-Tech-Calif-Finalizes-Open-Data-Portal-Kansas-City-Reveals-Startup-Partners.html].


-  Boston is launching a new website, CTHRU, that allows people to scroll
through everything from government salary lists to old city budgets, (reports
WWLP)[http://wwlp.com/2016/09/05/cthru-aims-to-unlock-potential-of-open-data-in-state-government/].
It's run by Socrata.

### Vet Politics:

-  Months after Veterans Affairs Secretary Bob McDonald asked for money to
address issues at VA, he was back at Congress to plead with lawmakers to
pass the 2017 budget, (reports Military Times)[http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/mcdonald-letter-congress-action?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DMilitary%20EBB%209-1-16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief].

### Vet Love:

-  The Veterans' unemployment rate has dipped back down below 5 percent,
(reports Military Times)[http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/it-was-a-hot-august-for-post-9-11-vet-employment?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DMilitary%20EBB%209-6-16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief].

### What we're reading:

-  Companies considered to have the best workplace cultures say there are
still things they would have done differently, (writes Product Hunt for
Medium)[https://medium.com/product-hunt/how-the-best-companies-build-their-cultures-afb701757976#.inz127j8k]. For example, Buffer would have talked about its values on day one,
rather than waiting until it had 100 employees. And, the CEO of Timshel
says it's important to continue to talk about those values.
