###  Open Data:

- There’s a new board game about open data, [reports the Open Data Institute](http://www.opendata.institute/news/you-can-now-buy-your-own-copy-of-datopolis-the-open-data-board-game). No really. Now you and your family can geek out on building services, apps and websites in Sheridan, “which is gradually declining as shops close, teachers quit, hedgehogs go extinct and pollution rises.”

- In the meantime, New York City is working through how to make public records easier to access, [reports Statescoop.com](http://statescoop.com/a-year-after-a-policy-update-nyc-grapples-with-the-next-level-of-open-data).

- The Palo Alto, Calif., city manager says that as governments work toward more open data, they should also seek to decentralize their IT systems, [reports Governing.com](http://www.governing.com/columns/tech-talk/gov-information-technology-rules.html).

- Virginia Tech students have been looking at Arlington, Va., data to see if they can come up with solutions to local problems, [reports StateScoop.com](http://statescoop.com/students-share-data-analytics-research-with-virginia-county-to-improve-efficiency).

- Open Data Inception [has a map up](https://opendatainception.io/) of all the open-data portals in the world. 

- [Devex argues](https://www.devex.com/news/are-ngos-doing-enough-to-share-data-88455) that NGOs could help more people if they opened up more data. 

- New York City bloggers strike again: This time, a blogger showed the city wrongly issued thousands of parking tickets to legally parked cars, [reports The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jul/26/open-data-blogger-parking-tickets-new-york-nypd). 

###  Open Government:

- [FiveThirtyEight used Baton Rouge’s open government portal](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/baton-rouge-drug-enforcement-has-plummeted-since-police-killed-alton-sterling/) to determine that drug enforcement has gone down since Alton Sterline was shot, which may mean the police are engaging less with the community. 

- The GSA recently released Data to Decisions (D2D) as a place to organize data, [reports MeriTalk.com](https://www.meritalk.com/articles/gsa-platform-to-address-open-data-goals/).

- The OMD released new governance for how to manage information resources, [reports Government Executive](http://www.govexec.com/management/2016/07/omb-releases-long-awaited-update-information-management-guidance/130249/). 

- The number of governments around the world embracing open government has surged, [reports fedscoop](http://fedscoop.com/number-of-countries-embracing-open-government-surges).

###  Plain Language:
- Hmm. Vets who go to the emergency room often have their claims denied because they don’t understand the process, [reports WSAW.com](http://www.wsaw.com/content/news/NewsChannel-7-Investigates--VA-denying-nearly-1-out-of-every-3-veterans-emergency-claims.html?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Mil%20EBB%207.29.16&utm_term=Editorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief). Wonder if The So Company can help with that, if it hasn’t already been addressed on a new Vets.gov page?

###  Tech Contracts:
- Booz-Allen has been awarded a contract to provide Navy IT support, [reports C4ISRNet](http://www.c4isrnet.com/story/military-tech/cyber/2016/08/01/booz-allen-navy-it-cyber/87926276/).

- Because so few people are trained for tech jobs in the government, a former White House CTO says *“it’s easier than ever to get engaged in government without dedicating a decade of work to civic engagement. Techies can opt in and out of several initiatives,”* [reports CRN.com](http://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/video/300081533/u-s-government-challenged-by-techie-talent-gap.htm).

###  Tech Politics:

- [Federal News Radio explains](http://federalnewsradio.com/management/2016/07/better-dod-va-collaboration-center-clintons-veterans-policy/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Mil%20EBB%207.29.16&utm_term=Editorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief) how presidential contenders Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump would handle Veterans Affairs’ healthcare, should they be elected. 

- And VP nominee Tim Kaine released so much of his government’s data that it’s still being sorted, [reports WVTF.org](http://wvtf.org/post/tim-kaines-position-open-government#stream/0).

###  Vet Love:
- We’re finally recognizing Veterans for their service in Laos, [reports The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/us/secret-war-laos-gary-rose.html?_r=0&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Military%20EBB%208-1-16&utm_term=Editorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief). Prior to now, the fighting in Laos—along with its acts of courage and ensuing pain—never happened…

- VA is still having a hard time hiring physicians, nurses and psychologists, and that staff members in those fields are quickly leaving the government, [reports Federal Times](http://www.federaltimes.com/story/government/management/agency/2016/08/01/clinical-job-losses-rise-vha/87921234/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Military%20EBB%208-2-16&utm_term=Editorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief). 

- In the meantime, the President says VA has made progress, and that wait times are shorter, and homelessness is down, [reports The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/us/politics/obama-donald-trump-veterans-khan.html?_r=0&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Military%20EBB%208-2-16&utm_term=Editorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief). He acknowledged that there are still problems. 


- However, the goal of zero homeless Veterans is still far in the distance, [reports Military Times](http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/benefits/veterans/2016/08/01/there-fewer-homeless-vets-but-goal-reaching-zero-far-off/87908682/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Military%20EBB%208-2-16&utm_term=Editorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief).
