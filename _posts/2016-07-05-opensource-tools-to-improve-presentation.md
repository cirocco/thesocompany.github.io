### Open Data:
- As government agencies receive poor marks for allowing access to data, but presenting in formats that can’t be used, [OpenSource.com offers eight open-source tools](https://opensource.com/business/16/6/top-business-intelligence-reporting-tools) to make data presentation better. 

- Others wonder if libraries might be the best place to house and present open data, [writes Chris Moore](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/libraries-become-stewards-our-open-data-collections-chris-moore?articleId=8995249922075345939). This could solve several issues: 
    1. Librarians could be trained in public data. 
    2. Libraries could house software programs that would allow people to look at data they might otherwise not be able to see. 
    3. Libraries need a future. 

- Wyoming, meanwhile, is trying to figure out how to charge people money to see state data, [reports wyofile.com](http://www.wyofile.com/state-charge-public-see-documents/).

- Large cities don’t own the market for good open-data programs, [reports the Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2016/06/29/why-are-some-cities-so-good-at-releasing-open-data-pt-2/). Smaller cities, like Asheville, N.C., and Hartford, Conn., have good programs because they’re centralized, allow private users instant access and insist on clear deadlines for implementation. 

- Medicare will release the cancer-care data set for more than 10 million cases, [according to DocGraph](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/docgraph-to-release-the-most-accurate-data-picture-to-date-of-how-cancer-is-treated-by-medicare-300292180.html), which will manage the data. The data will be open to anyone. 

- California has appointed its first chief data officer, Zachary Townsend, [reports Government Technology](http://www.govtech.com/people/Inaugural-Chief-Data-Officer-Appointed-California.html). 

### Plain Language:
- Minnesota is on a plain-language crusade, and the governor’s office released a video [portraying two buddies watching a baseball game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X8RVXAskPU). One speaks like a normal human, and one speaks like an email from a bureaucrat. 

- A plain language forum on LinkedIn, PLAIN, has just [been taken over by Plain Language International](http://plainlanguagenetwork.org/plain-takes-over-management-of-plain-language-supporters-group-on-linkedin/#.V3qsyLgrI2w) ([@PLAIN_Lang_Intl](http://www.twitter.com/plain_lang_intl)), a volunteer group of plain-language advocates. 

### Geek Love:
- Conspiracy theorists hope presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will, if she becomes president, continue the open-data push and release the X-Files, [reports NBC News](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/alien-conspiracy-theorists-hope-clinton-will-open-x-files-n590001).

- Ten technology trends are hitting the workforce, including “open any data,” the “Internet of things,” and “software-defined architecture,” [reports memeburn.com](http://memeburn.com/2016/06/10-massive-tech-trends-changing-way-governments-work/).

### Vet Love:
- A Virginian-Pilot photographer, known for his coverage of the effects of Agent Orange on people in Vietnam, recently learned his own health problems might be related to his estranged father’s spraying of the chemical during the war, [the Virginian-Pilot reports](https://psmag.com/a-fathers-war-a-son-s-toxic-inheritance-2eb6f511cef0#.fsesj6nm7).

### Geek Jobs:
- Betah Associates [seeks a part-time writer](http://www.indeed.com/cmp/Betah-Associates/jobs/Health-Writer-Editor-6e1bd9c385f2efbe?sjdu=QwrRXKrqZ3CNX5W-O9jEvaK-IqlRfWx3R8EWF6AqU54M9WkJEVefWA0UMD1-B1NMlDK8qAGOKXh1QLv8Zb5frg) to explain the new national dietary guidelines in plain language. 

### Telework Love:
- Slack [has a video](https://slackhq.com/how-to-customize-notifications-in-slack-dae9891dc01a#.m0ipyi9k3) that shows how to cut back on the number of notifications you receive.
