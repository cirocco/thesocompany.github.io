### Plain Language:

- There's a [plain-language group at LinkedIn](http://plainlanguagenetwork.org/plain/linkedin-plain-group/#.V8R9C5grI2w) that tussles with daily writing questions, such as, "Has anyone tried the Hemingway app?" or, "How do you explain to your boss it takes me three hours to rewrite something he's already written?" Anyone interested in
plain writing can join.

- Using positive language, even when writing about negative things, makes people feel better, [writes the Center for Plain Language](http://enterforplainlanguage.org/positive-language-makes-our-brains-happier/). It also brings in more clients.

- [The Write Clearly Blog suggests](https://writeclearlyblog.com/2016/08/30/write-better-sentences-by-starting-with-the-subject/) always starting a sentence with the subject. That's the easiest way to create an active-voice sentence.

### Open Data:

- After years of regulation and campaigns against drunk driving led to lower highway deaths, the trend has started to rise again. And while everyone has ideas - texting, cheap gas so more people on the road, aging highway systems - no one knows for sure what is causing the increase. So, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released a whole bunch of data and asked for help finding the answer, [reports Tech Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/29/nhtsa-releases-raw-2015-traffic-fatality-data-calls-for-tech-companies-to-analyze/).

- Chicago began installing 500 nodes on city streets as part of its Array of Things project, which asks partners to use data to figure out how best to address traffic, air quality and flooding, [reports the University of Chicago](https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2016/08/29/chicago-becomes-first-city-launch-array-things).

- Virginia just hosted a hackathon to see if software developers could come up with some solutions to the state's unemployment issue, [reports WVTF radio](http://wvtf.org/post/virginia-hosts-hackathon-using-state-data#stream/0).

### Open Government:

- [The State Department is hosting](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2016/08/261118.htm) an online discussion through Aug. 31 of its Open-Government Plan.

- The White House will participate in the [Data Foundation's Open Data Conference](http://technical.ly/dc/2016/08/22/data-foundation-open-data-conference/) Sept. 28 with an [Open-Data Innovation Summit](https://www.data.gov/event/ white-house-open-data-innovation-summit/). It's free and open to all. (It's at the Washington Convention Center, so don't be thinking you'll have open access to the Lincoln Bedroom.)

- Pennsylvania just became the 41st state to launch an open-data portal, [reports
WITF](http://www.witf.org/state-house-sound-bites/2016/08/pa-launches-open-data-site-joining-many-other-states.php).

### Vet Jobs:

- Veterans Affairs is hiring Veterans Experience Officers at the regional level, including [this position in Los Angeles](https://jobview.mycareeratva.va.gov/GetJob.aspx?JobID=3D171443571&JobTitle=3DDistrict+Veterans+Experience+Officer+](Pacific)&fedemp=3Dy&fedpub=3Dy&jbf571=3D12&jbf522=3D1102&selSubCat=3D1102&brd=3D6960&AVSDM=3D2016-08-29T06%3a57%3a00-05%3a00).

### Vet Politics:

- Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America scored when candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump agreed to talk military issues, but now libertarian candidate Gary Johnson would also like to get in on the hour-long session, [reports Military Times](http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/veterans-group-pressured-to-let-gary-johnson-join-forum-with-trump-clinton?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DEarly%20Bird%208.26.16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief).


### Vet Love:

- Veterans Affairs will no longer fly the Confederate flag on flagpoles at its cemeteries, [reports Military Times](http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/confederate-flag-va-cemeteries-change?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DMilitary%20EBB%208-29-16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief). The agency was clear in stating that the large flags will be removed because of their history as a racist symbol.

### What we're reading:

- It's the old quality-versus-quantity argument - or the crux of Tim Ferriss's fortune: How many hours a day does a person need to work to be successful? Well, it matters not a lick if it takes four hours to get moving in the morning. [Medium's Benjamin Hardy argues that](https://medium.com/the-mission/how-to-structure-your-day-for-optimal-performance-and-productivity-dcbf0665e3f3#.9pa0g1laz)
if you work a steady, focused two to five hours in the morning, you might be done for the day. 'Course, he starts at 5 a.m....

- Fascinating: About 10 percent of people work remotely, and developers who work from home have salaries that tend to be higher than those who work in the office, [reports Quincy Larson at Free Code Camp](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-economics-of-working-remotely-28d4173e16e2#.sg74yaqrj). And, a study found that remote workers are 13 percent more productive than people who work in the office. (It's the guilt factor - those focused hours before they escape for hikes.) They also work longer shifts, take fewer breaks and don't use as many sick days.
