> We have an addition to the weekly newsletter from The So Company's favorite copy editor, Beth Potts. Look for general tips on plain-language writing, as well as tips specific to Veterans Affairs:

### Copyediting Greatest Hits:

This is the first installment of Copyediting Greatest Hits! Every week I'll  share some additions to the style guide or interesting examples of plain-language edits.

Here are last week's three additions to our Terms list:

- deceased: Favor this word over "decedent," which is chiefly a legal term.

- gravesite: Style this as one word. (Merriam-Webster does not address whether this should be one or two words, but the Gravesite Locator and Arlington National Cemetery both style it as one word. In addition, the following related words do appear in Merriam-Webster as one: graveside and gravestone.)

- Social Security number: Use this capitalization per Merriam-Webster (do not
cap "number").

If you're tired of watching Last Week Tonight and Bob's Burgers, take a look at the ever-expanding [Vets.gov Style Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-content/blob/master/Content%20Team/Editorial-style-guide/guide.md).

### Plain Language:

- [The Center for Plain Language offers](http://centerforplainlanguage.org/trimmed-gobbledygook/) a cure for "gobbledygook" in a blog this week. They offer an example: "Management has become cognizant of the necessity of eliminating undesirable vegetation surrounding the periphery of the facility."

- And scientists are learning that if they write their abstracts in "plain language," people might actually read them, [writes the American Geophysical Union](http://blogs.agu.org/sciencecommunication/2016/09/12/value-plain-language-abstract/).


### Open Data:

- Deutsche bank is creating an open-data lab in Dublin and hiring 165 people to work there, [reports The Irish Times](http://www.irishtimes.com/business/financial-services/deutsche-bank-to-create-165-jobs-in-dublin-and-open-data-lab-1.2785448).


### Open Government:

- The Department of Transportation just released the first national open-data transit map, [reports fedscoop](http://fedscoop.com/dot-releases-national-open-data-transit-map). It includes information from one-third of the country's urban transit systems.

- To be a forward-thinking city, Wilmington, Delaware, should adopt data for economic growth, city services and transparency, [writes Technical.ly](http://technical.ly/delaware/2016/09/12/eugene-young-data-wilmington/).

- Government tech is hitting its stride - but it feels like 1997, according to the White House's Chief Technology Officer, [reports Tech Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/12/megan-smith-and-alexander-macgillivray-tout-obama-administrations-tech-victories-but-its-a-work-in-progress/). Still, folks are sharing code and working on data-driven government, she says.

### Job Search:

- OPM is working to make it easier to apply for a government job, [reports the Washington  Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/09/12/want-to-apply-for-a-job-with-the-government-usajobs-overhaul-seeks-to-make-it-easier/?utm_campaign=3DMilitary%20EBB%209-13-16&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_source=3DSailthru).

### Vet Politics:

- In preparation for a debate sponsored by IAVA, Donald Trump promoted privatizing Veterans Affairs, while Hillary Clinton argued for improving, rather than privatizing, VA, [reports Military  Times](http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/trump-clinton-dueling-speeches-veterans-preview?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DMilitary%20EBB%209-7-16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief). Veterans have found it's difficult to find docs who specialize in post-traumatic stress or issues related to Agent Orange, burn-pit exposure or Gulf War illness outside VA.

- If presidential candidate Donald Trump releases his tax forms, a co-founder of LinkedIn has promised to give $5 million to Veterans' groups, [reports The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/us/politics/linkedin-hoffman-trump-tax-returns-veterans.html?module=3DWatchingPortal&region=3Dc-column-middle-span-region&pgType=3DHomepage&action=3Dclick&mediaId=3Dthumb_square&state=3Dstandard&contentPlacement=3D2&version=3Dinternal&contentCollection=3Dwww.nytimes.com&contentId=3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F09%2F14%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Flinkedin-hoffman-trump-tax-returns-veterans.html&eventName=3DWatching-article-click&_r=3D1).

### Vet Love:

- Veterans can now apply for health-care benefits over the phone, [reports Military Times](http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/va-now-taking-health-benefits-applications-by-phone?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DMilitary%20EBB%209-13-16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief).

### What we're reading:

- [Rachel Thomas writes in Medium that](https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/donations-and-women-in-tech-panels-are-not-a-diversity-strategy-do-better-c3c51022a916#.mj1halrtc), despite data showing diverse companies make higher profits, big companies still cite old excuses for not hiring women and minorities. Adding women to tech panels and making donations to diversity initiatives isn't enough.

- Film critic [Christopher Campbell offers](https://filmschoolrejects.com/6-filmmaking-tips-from-clint-eastwood-5c9fdd7b0e35#.fynbd9y8s)
six film-making tips from Clint Eastwood, including getting enough sleep, that could apply to any endeavor.
