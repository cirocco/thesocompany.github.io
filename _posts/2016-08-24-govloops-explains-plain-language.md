### Plain Language:
- [Govloops quickly lays out](https://www.govloop.com/groups/digitalcommunication/forum/topic/tell-it-to-me-straight-plain-language/) the five steps of plain-language writing that have been making the rounds. It may seem obvious to those who write, but it's helpful when explaining how the process works and why it takes some time.

- [Plainlanguage.gov](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/plLaw/fedGovt/index.cfm)
has a list of every government agency's plain-language webpage, as well as
the designated senior official. [Veterans Affairs is here](http://www.va.gov/opa/Plain_Language.asp).

- Lawyers - who may be guilty of some, well, lawyer-speak - have addressed the
issue of bad fonts (and, gasp!, two periods after sentences) in
[Lawyerist.com](https://lawyerist.com/115103/hey-hey-ho-ho-19th-century-fonts-got-go/).
Get this: Alabama appellate courts recommend the use of Courier font. Now
don't you feel good about your day?

- Back in the day, police officers used code when they talked over the
radio to reduce tying up the airwaves, [writes PoliceOne.com](https://www.policeone.com/cad-pc/articles/212078006-Should-police-codes-be-phased-out-once-and-for-all/).
Those codes were never standardized, so much like the recent hospital
incident where a man passed out while his wife was giving birth and the
security team responded thinking the problem was a bomb threat, things get
confusing. A federal law in 2006 called for the end of the codes in favor
of plain language, but departments are slow to change. It's so much easier
to say "187" than "murder".

### Open Data:

- Tackling a couple of topics, rather than opening up everything, can be a
good way to go about open data for a small government, [reports Government
Technology](http://www.govtech.com/data/Analytics-Turning-a-Flood-of-Data-into-Valuable-Information.html).
However, it still takes a lot of effort and money to ensure the data is
available in the first place, and that no errors are made in processing
that data.

- Sometimes that data is so convoluted that it's attacked only by
journalists who dig through and then give up and submit
Freedom-of-Information-Act requests, [writes The Aspen Institute](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/blog-posts/open-data-goes-die/). That's a
lot of wasted resources. In fact, most open-data sites are badly designed
because they throw spaghetti at the wall, rather than planning carefully,
they write.

- And speaking of FOIA, the Defense Department needs to update its
policies, [reports The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/291841-watchdog-pentagon-needs-to-update-foia-policies?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DNew%20Campaign&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief),
and hasn't, in some cases, for 17 years.

- The Justice Department believes intervening early with officers who
violate rules can protect citizens, but when Justice looked at data from
several departments, no one was tracking what happened after those early
interventions, reports The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/can-big-data-stop-bad-cops/2016/08/21/12db0728-3fb6-11e6-a66f-aa6c1883b6b1_story.html?utm_campaign=3DMilitary%20EBB%208-22-16&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_source=3DSailthru).
Officials wonder if big data could help the departments=E2=80=94and the
country=E2=80=94better track and protect.

### Open Government:

- Providing citizens with data from the government can mean the government
ends up with better programs and systems, [reports Ideas.ted.com](http://ideas.ted.com/how-open-government-data-creates-smarter-societies/). But it also allows people to make smart decisions about things like health care and renting an apartment.

- [The General Services Administration is hosting a session](http://us9.campaign-archive2.com/?u=3D6f1977de9eff4c384dc8d6527&id=3Ddd5d1b8d4a&e=3Ddd8a98a197)
at 9 a.m. Sept. 8 to help people better understand how the Technology Transformation Service buys, builds and shares federal-government technology.

### Tech/Writing Contracts:

- [The Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate](https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=3Dopportunity&mode=3Dform&tab=3Dcore&id=3D6c36c57398359f94da3bd27ab0ea789a) is looking for a writer or team or writers to communicate between the directorate and its stakeholders, government agencies and the public.

### Vet Politics:

- Presidential candidate Donald Trump is leading Hillary Clinton in polls
by 10 percentage points among military families, [reports The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/291654-poll-trump-leads-clinton-among-military-households?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DMilitary%20EBB%208-17-16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief).


### Vet Love:

- Veterans Affairs is testing 33 private-sector-inspired projects to try
to make their programs faster and better, [reports Task & Purpose](http://taskandpurpose.com/va-partnering-private-sector-solve-biggest-problems/?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DMilitary%20EBB%208-17-16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief). The VA Innovators Project is looking at mental health care in emergency rooms, cardiac rehabilitation at home through technology, and community
hubs for Veterans who want more say in their treatments.

- Some innovators presented their ideas Shark-Tank style, offering Fitbits
for older patients, Apple watches to Veterans in rural areas to monitor activity, and having nurses determine if same-day appointments were necessary for some patients, [reports Military Times](http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/va-employees-pitch-ideas-on-health-services?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DMilitary%20EBB%208-22-16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief).


- Thirty-one Veterans will compete in the Paralympics in Rio in
September, [reports Task & Purpose](http://taskandpurpose.com/31-veterans-headed-paralympics-team-usa/?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DMilitary%20EBB%208-18-16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief). Because of course.

- Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans of America will host a debate between Donald
Trump and Hillary Clinton that focuses on Veterans' and military issues
Sept. 7, [reports Military Times](http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/veterans-issues-2016-election-final-push?utm_source=3DSailthru&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_campaign=3DMilitary%20EBB%208-22-16&utm_term=3DEditorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief).


### What we're reading:

- On some level, we probably all know what has led to our greatest "aha!" moments. But The Mission put together [a five-step guide](https://medium.com/the-mission/for-a-more-creative-brain-follow-these-5-steps-2a248250e4a0#.9mbglesxc) to coming up with an idea that, well, "aha!" It might not be quite as nebulous and free-flowing as we like to believe.
