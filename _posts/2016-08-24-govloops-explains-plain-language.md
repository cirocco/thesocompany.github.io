### Plain Language:
- [Govloops quickly lays out](https://www.govloop.com/groups/digitalcommunication/forum/topic/tell-it-to-me-straight-plain-language/> the five steps of plain-language writing that have been making the rounds. It may seem obvious to those who write, but it's helpful when explaining how the process works and why it takes some time.

- [Plainlanguage.gov](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/plLaw/fedGovt/index.cfm>
has a list of every government agency's plain-language webpage, as well as
the designated senior official. [Veterans Affairs is here](http://www.va.gov/opa/Plain_Language.asp).

- Lawyers - who may be guilty of some, well, lawyer-speak - have addressed the
issue of bad fonts (and, gasp!, two periods after sentences) in
[Lawyerist.com](https://lawyerist.com/115103/hey-hey-ho-ho-19th-century-fonts-got-go/).
Get this: Alabama appellate courts recommend the use of Courier font. Now
don't you feel good about your day?

- Back in the day, police officers used code when they talked over the
radio to reduce tying up the airwaves, [writes PoliceOne.com](https://www.policeone.com/cad-pc/articles/212078006-Should-police-codes-be-phased-out-once-and-for-all/).
Those codes were never standardized, so much like the recent hospital
incident where a man passed out while his wife was giving birth and the
security team responded thinking the problem was a bomb threat, things get
confusing. A federal law in 2006 called for the end of the codes in favor
of plain language, but departments are slow to change. It's so much easier
to say "187" than "murder".

### Open Government:
-  The White House announced Monday that it was implementing a policy to make code written by the federal government open-source, [reports The Christian Science Monitor](http://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/2016/0809/White-House-open-source-software-policy-goes-live). This will allow agencies to collaborate and reuse programs, as well as making software the government develops useful to the public.

-  After the White House announced an initiative to use open code for its software, the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/08/white-house-source-code-policy-should-go-further) writes that the proposal was significantly watered-down.

 
### Plain Language:
-  [Govloops quickly lays out](https://www.govloop.com/groups/digitalcommunication/forum/topic/tell-it-to-me-straight-plain-language/) the five steps of plain-language writing that have been making the rounds. It may seem obvious to those who write, but it’s helpful when explaining how the process works and why it takes some time.

-  [The National Institutes of Health seeks to help health professionals](https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/nih-office-director/office-communications-public-liaison/clear-communication/science-health-public-trust/clearing-path-understanding) write their messages in a way their patients actually understand, which could potentially save thousands of lives, as well as millions of dollars. One recommendation? “Use everyday words.”

-  [Quote.com looked at public figures through the ages and found](https://quote.com/blog/smartest-speeches-analyzing-the-grade-level-of-leaders-public-comments/), for the most part, they use plain language—and it’s important because, they write, one-quarter of Americans read below a fifth-grade level. Interestingly, Clarence Thomas speaks at tenth-grade reading level, while Bill Gates speaks at a seventh-grade level.

Tech Contracts:
-  NASA is soliciting contract writers to write web stories, presentations and speeches, develop content for government documents, write press releases and create brochures, [according to FBO.gov](https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&tab=core&id=6c36c57398359f94da3bd27ab0ea789a).

 
### Tech politics:
-  [The Conversation looks at](http://theconversation.com/can-big-data-studies-know-your-thoughts-and-predict-who-will-win-an-election-63110) whether big data can analyze the Internet to determine whom we’re going to vote for in the fall. But the article also touches on why data scientists will be in such huge demand in the future.

### Geek Love:
-  Here in DC, we’ve all avoided Poke-minded tourists chasing creatures on busy sidewalks, but Pokemon offers an easy-to-understand example of “augmented reality,” [reports Government Technology](http://www.govtech.com/computing/What-Is-Augmented-Reality.html). Some governments are using similar technology to create text overlays for monuments and bird-identification information in parks.

### Vet Love:
-  As Veterans Affairs works to find a replacement for its outdated VistA electronic health record system,

-  Docs are seeing a connection between posttraumatic stress symptoms that don’t respond to treatment and the possibility of a mefloquine overdose, [reports Military Times](http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/2016/08/11/malaria-drug-causes-permanent-brain-damage-case-study/88528568/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Mil%20EBB%208.12.16&utm_term=Editorial%20-%20Military%20-%20Early%20Bird%20Brief).

-  The Pentagon is one step closer to extending online commissary benefits to Vets, [reports Military Times](http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/benefits/2016/08/15/pentagon-closer-extending-generous-new-benefit-millions-veterans/88775046/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Military+EBB+8-16-15&utm_term=Editorial+-+Military+-+Early+Bird+Brief).

### What we’re reading:
-  Businesses lose $650 million to “multitasking” every year, [writes the author of Massive Life Success](https://medium.com/art-of-practicality/how-to-quit-your-multitasking-addiction-2d2edf740649#.etj4m2sp3). He has a few questions to help determine if you  are addicted to multitasking, including, “Do you reach for your phone every five minutes?” and “Do you ever find it hard to focus on one thing?” Eep.
